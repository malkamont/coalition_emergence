# complexcoalitions

The repository includes the data and the code (Python + R) for replicating the results in "Complex coalitions: political alliances across relational contexts" [arxiv]. The code for Python includes the functions that allow for inferring the planted partition model that provides the best fit to an empirical multilayer network. The current implementation does not support edge weights.

Example use case under construction.
