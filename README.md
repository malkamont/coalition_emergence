# coalition_emergence

Repository includes data and code (Python + R) for replicating the results in "Complex coalitions: political alliances across relational contexts" [arxiv]. Python code includes functions that allow for inferring the multilayer community structure that provides the best fit to an empirical multilayer network according to the planted partition stochastic block model. Current implementation does not support edge weights.

Example use case under construction.
